PyMapManager is a suite of Python tools to visualize, annotate, and analyze time-series image volumes. PyMapManager opens annotations created with the Igor Pro version of [Map Manager][1], allowing additional visualization and analysis to easily be performed.

There are three components to PyMapManager:

1. A Python package
2. A web server
3. A desktop application.

## 1) PyMapManager Python package

Install with

	pip install PyMapManager

To get started writing Python code to extend Map Manager analysis, see the iPython notebooks in the [/examples][5] folder. For more detailed install instructions, see [Install PyMapManager](install-pymapmanager). See the [API Documentation][2] for a full description of all the classes and functions.

## 2) PyMapManager server

The PyMapManager server provides a web-based front-end to browse Map Manager annotations and images. The PyMapManager server also provides a [REST API][6] to retrieve Map Manager annotations and images from within your favorite programming environment.

## 3) PyMapManager deskop application

**Development of this desktop application has been downgraded to focus on the PyMapManager web interface.**

The Qt version of PyMapManager is a desktop application. See [/PyQtMapManager][4].
